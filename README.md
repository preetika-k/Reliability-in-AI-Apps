# Reliability-in-AI-Apps
Performing comprehensive data analysis to detect potential interface issues.




The Roundtable AI app is a powerful tool that uses artificial intelligence to simulate custom surveys. It is trained on a massive dataset of internet data, which allows it to generate realistic and engaging surveys.

In the early stages of development, I created queries and prompts to assess the potential interface errors. I also conducted thorough data analysis, including testing the chat box, drop-down menu, and reliability of the time frame. I designed distinct user input requests to assess and validate the reliability of the app. 

The first image shows incorrrect statistics given the relationship between the topic question and year that is prompted.

The last two images show illogical reasoning for a question where the answer wouldn't change mereley upon what type of pet the respondent has.

These specific analyses allowed the developer to improve on the backend errors.
