# Reliability-in-AI-Apps
Performing comprehensive data analysis to detect potential interface issues.




The Roundtable AI app is a powerful tool that uses artificial intelligence to simulate custom surveys. It is trained on a massive dataset of internet data, which allows it to generate realistic and engaging surveys.

In the early stages of development, I created queries and prompts to assess the potential interface errors. I also conducted thorough data analysis, including testing the chat box, drop-down menu, and reliability of the time frame. I designed distinct user input requests to assess and validate the reliability of the app.
